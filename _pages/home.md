# Welcome to the Linger Longer in Longmont Calendar site! 

## What is this fabulous Longmont calendar?

## Who is responsible for this great idea? 
The Linger Longer in Longmont Calendar team is a group of local creatives, business owners, and community liaisons who decided that a calendar is a great way to highlight all our community has to offer. We hope this calendar motivates you to join, celebrate, and plan with Longmont in mind.
